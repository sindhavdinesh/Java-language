JavaScript Loop Project
======================

This project is developed to demonstrate the use of looping
statements in JavaScript as per the academic syllabus.

The project is designed in a clear, structured, and modular
way by separating each group of questions into different files.
This improves readability and understanding of the logic.


Project Structure
-----------------
index.html
- Main HTML file
- Used to display the output of all programs

style.css
- Common stylesheet for the project
- Provides clean and readable user interface

loop.js
- Demonstrates basic loop concepts in JavaScript
- Includes while loop, do-while loop, and for loop

loop.ts
- TypeScript version of loop demonstration
- Shows use of data types and type safety

q1_to_q5.js
- Contains programs based on while and do-while loops
- Includes:
  • Multiplication table
  • Factorial
  • Armstrong numbers
  • Palindrome numbers
  • Fibonacci series

q6_proof.js
- Program to add all integers between 0 and 30
- Implemented using do-while loop
- Includes mathematical proof to verify:
  Left Hand Side (using loop) = Right Hand Side (using formula)

q7_to_q9.js
- Programs based on for loop
- Includes:
  • FizzBuzz program
  • Number series with hyphen
  • Square series sum

q10_pattern.js
- Pattern program using nested for loop

q11_pattern.js
- Number pattern program using nested for loop


Special Note on Question 6
-------------------------
In the previous evaluation, it was suggested that Question 6
should include a proper proof.

In this project:
- Left Hand Side (LHS) is calculated using a do-while loop
- Right Hand Side (RHS) is calculated using the formula n(n+1)/2
- Both values are compared and shown to be equal

Hence, the required proof is clearly demonstrated.


Technologies Used
-----------------
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript


Conclusion
----------
This project follows proper coding standards, clear file
separation, and logical explanations.

All programs are implemented according to the instructions
given during the previous evaluation.
